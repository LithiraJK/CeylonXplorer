    <h2>Ancient Rock Fortress</h2>
    <p>Sigiriya, a massive column of rock, vertically rises 200m from its labyrinths of inhospitable forested plains encompassing a water garden, boulder gardens, and terrace gardens. Located in the Matale District in the Central Province of Sri Lanka, this fortress city is embellished with water gardens, boulder and cave gardens, terraced grass gardens, frescoes and a mirror wall which are derived as a resultant of the profusion of Sinhalese civilization mingled with the long cherished artistic, archeological, architectural, historical and cultural values. It is also renowned for the mesmeric vistas across the land.</p>
    <img src="/assets/images/sigiriya-rock.jpg" alt="sigiriya-rock">
    <h3>Historical Background</h3>
    <p>The historical roots of Sigiriya run back to the third century BC when this place served for the Buddhist monks as a rock-shelter mountain monastery. During the time of 477-495CE, this place served as the dwelling for King Kassapa, who was born to one of the wives of King Dhatusena, the first king of the Moriyan dynasty. Kassapa rebelled against his father for declaring Moggallana, the son of the most favored queen of the king, as the heir to the throne. This political mayhem articulated with Kassapa consolidating power drove Moggallana away to India, but he vowed to return from India and reclaim the throne.</p>
    
    <p>Inspired by his cherished desire of creating his version of earthly paradise coincided with the intention of making preparations for the expected invasion from Moggallana, the rightful heir to the throne, Kassapa orchestrated his abode as a perdurable fortress with defensive structures. This ancient citadel complex is identified to be the oldest as well as the best example for ancient city planning, water engineering. Palace and other structures on this fortress city as well as the structures surrounding the Sigiriya rock were declared as a world heritage by the UNESCO in 1982.</p>
    
    <p>The pleasure-dome of king Kashyapa is designed based on a fixed axial modular geometric plan, with a straight open path stretching from the entrance towards the rock in an imaginary east-west axis around which the whole city is built upon. There are two moats and several dams around Sigiriya rock to ensure security.</p>
    

    <h3>Sigiriya Water Garden</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/sigiriya-water-garden.jpg" alt="sigiriya-water-garden">
    <p>Clinging to the moats is a water garden in which the first section is fashioned gathering four pools, centering a small island, with pathways running towards the surrounding gardens. Beyond this area lies a lovely fountain encompassing ponds and channels nourished by a serpentine-shaped little river. The hydraulics system which was designed to circulate water to the lakes and water fountains is said to be built in the fifth century, perhaps the world's oldest complex water circulation system.</p>
    
    <p>This complex drainage system consists of surface and underground canals, locks, lakes, bridges, fountains and underground as well as surface water pumps. It is said to perfectly equalize the ponds and prevent flooding on the rock top in the rainy season. Demonstrating the hydraulic sophistication of the ancient architect, even after a thousand and five hundred years from their initial construction, these fountains proudly gush water in their original form, making the travelers enthralled.</p>
    
    <h3>Several Other Rock Shelters</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/sigiriya-srilanka.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The main path leads to the boulder garden which spreads across the area that follows after the water garden. Dispersed across Sigiri forested plains, there are approximately twenty rock shelters which have been serving for the monks as monastery buildings even before Kassapa's era. They provide an impressive sight for the explorers. This garden lacks the symmetrical structure prevailing in the water garden and holds an asymmetrical structure as it is shaped around the rock formations which were existing.</p>
    
    <p>The Deraniyagala cave comes into the vicinity shortly after ascending through the garden. It protects the remaining faded damsels within its stone walls and the well-preserved dripstone ledges. Preaching Rock containing tiered platforms believed to have been used by orating monks while Asana Chapel has served as a meeting hall for monks. Cobra Hood Rock is a little deviated from the main path and has been named due to the Archaic Brahmi script inscription on the ledge dated to the second century BC.</p>
    
    <h3>Sigiriya Frescoes</h3>
    <p>Sigiri frescoes are the most iconic and mostly celebrated non-religious paintings which demonstrate the prowess of the ancient Sri Lankan artistry at its zenith. At a short distance from the base, about 100 meters above ground, there lie two spiral cases which lead towards a sheltered cave. This cave once held the reputation for being the largest art gallery in the world, gracing an area of 140m in length and 40m in height.</p>
    
    <p>In this cave domicile, the most illustrious Sigiri Apsara (damsels) epitomize womanly beauty with their sinuous bodies, voluptuous bosoms and full lips blended with vibrant, fluid touches. Even though the exact identities of these damsels are unclear, many believe them to be King Kassapa's consorts of the harem. The most significant validation presented to prove this view is the three circled tattoo worn on the necks of these damsels, indicative of them being owned by the king. Another convincing theory by modern art historians is that these damsels portray celestial nymphs floating amongst the clouds while showering human beings with flowers.</p>
    
    <h3>Mirror Wall</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/sigiriya-frescoes.jpg" alt="frescoes">
    <p>Further along the Sigiri frescoes, halfway along the vertical western side of the rock is a wide pathway, with a two-meter high mirror-walled outer edge, connecting the north and the south. This highly polished white masonry parapet wall, known as the ‘Katapath Paura,' reflects the frescoes on the opposite wall. Invigorated by the overwhelming beauty of this place and the seductive damsels, travelers during the 8th and 14th centuries inscribed their deep-felt musings on the mirror wall, pouring their emotions into letters. More than 600 graffitis have been deciphered by archaeologists, demonstrating the fascination this place has evoked in visitors. The following graffiti is an excellent piece of art manifesting the staggering beauty of King Kassapa's dwelling.</p>
    
    <p>"Hail! I am vira-vidura bato [and] I wrote this. The gentle breeze blew — the breeze which is wet with cool dew drops — taking (with it) fragrant perfume, in the spring sunshine, the jasmine and the water-lily, being adorned with flowers shone all over. Leaving it (all aside), my mind was agitated on seeing these golden colored ones and, being shot at, whilst going, by their sidelong glances, I became prostrate on the slope of this rock. Having seen to my heart's content, the five hundred damsels on the surface of the rock, and having well remembered one (of them), Heaven (itself) does not take my mind." (Panique.com.au, 2018)</p>
    
    <p>The direct exposure to natural circumstances for over a thousand and five hundred years, with the passage of time, has led to the two ends of the mirror wall—connecting the southern end to the terraced gardens and the northern end to the lion platform—being replaced with two steel bridges.</p>
    
    <h3>Lions Gate Sigiriya</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/lions-gate-sirigiya.jpg" alt="lions-gate-sirigiya">
    <p>Right below the summit stand two massive lion paws, the only remnants of an enormous lion statue symbolizing Sinhalese royalty and pride. The staircase, starting at the lion's feet, goes around its massive body and finally enters its mouth. Some historians argue that the fortress city was built during the reign of an ancient king who lived long before King Kassapa. They contend that the paws beside the entrance are not lion paws—since a lion's paw typically has four fingers with one hidden—but instead, these gigantic paws have three fingers with protruding claws.</p>
    
    <p>The argument, proclaimed by these historians, suggests a mythological creature known as "Gurula," featuring bird legs, massive wings fixed to a human body with four human arms and an eagle head. They believe that this ancient city fortress was initially built by a king who placed Gurula in a venerable elevation, and that King Kassapa later adorned the site aesthetically. Thus, these massive paws are seen as resembling the paws of a Gurula rather than those of a lion.</p>
    
    <h3>Breathtaking Views From Sigiriya</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/pidurangala.jpg" alt="pidurangala">
    <p>On top of the rock lies a well-fortified citadel overlooking the area, its gardens and pools captivating travelers with astonishing vistas across a forested canopy. The slanting shaped summit, constructed with advanced engineering and architectural technology, stands roughly 200m above the ground and is divided into three distinct elevated areas.</p>
    
    <p>Sigiriya is undoubtedly a sight that one’s eyes should not miss. From the moment you begin your journey until you reach the peak, you experience a wide range of emotions—overwhelming happiness derived from the beauty of this fortress city, coupled with the fear and anxiety of climbing a steel staircase attached to a sheer rock.</p>

    <p>Anuradhapura remained as the capital city of Sri Lanka from the fourth century AD until the eleventh century AD. This city was one of the most strongholds and stable cities among the other capitals of South Asia. There were several instances where the invaders from other countries, especially from India usurped the city. However, the kings with the never-ceasing support from the Buddhist monks, coincided with the courage and the boldness of the Sinhalese people, fearlessly fought against these invaders and reunited the country.</p>
    
    <p>Anuradhapura is an era when the architecture, craftsmanship and water engineering was at its zenith. This is well demonstrated through the irrigation system prevailed at the time.

    <h3>Places To Visit In Anuradhapura</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/ruwanwelisaya-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="ruwanwelisaya-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Ruwanwelisaya</h4>
    Realizing the prophecy made by Arahant Mahinda Thero, who was sent to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka as a missionary by the great emperor Ashoka in India, King Dutugemunu, the peerless hero who defeated the greatest Indian invader of all time, king Elara who ruled Sri Lanka for 45 years, built Ruwanwelisaya. Known as Maha Stupa, Swarnamali Mahasaya and Rathnamali Chethiya, Ruwanwelisaya rises towards the sky blending and harmonizing the human world and the celestial worlds. This one of the finest creations of the Sri Lankan history which well demonstrates the prowess of the ancient artists fused with the astounding mathematical and architectural knowledge.</p>
    
    <p>For Buddhist, who live throughout the world, Ruwanwelisaya is venerated as the pinnacle of Buddhism. It is mainly because this Stupa contains the larges portion of the relics of Lord Buddha and according to the ancient chronicles its one-eighth of the relics. Being one of the main benefactors of Buddhism, King Dutugemunu was able to bring relics even from India. After depositing these relics, they made the largest stupa ever imaginable. It is 300 feet in height, and its diameter is 370 feet. After the Great War between himself and King Elara, King Dutugemunu was economically unable to patronize such a huge construction. However, his heart filled with devotion compelled the king of the gods, god Shaka to aid him with the material support. Thus he appointed god Vishwakarma to provide king Dutugemunu with the materials needed. Later all the required material appeared miraculously in the neighboring localities.</p>
    
    <p>There are four entrances to the sand compound and among the main entrance is the one you find on the Eastern side. Once you enter for this entrance, you can see two vases which are called “Punkalasa” with two lion figures standing by them. There is also a wall with 338 elephant figures engraved in it. Once you enter the stone podium of which the floor is designed, you will be able to see four small stupas situated in four directions worshipping the massive stupa standing at the middle demonstrating the power of Buddhism to guide the human beings towards the supreme bliss of Nibbana.</p>
    
    <p>It is wonderful how the ancient architect has embedded religious theories in its structure. This great Stupa takes the shape of a water bubble. The shape of the Stupa encompasses a sacred meaning, a meaning of impermanence. Then there is the pinnacle with a glistening crest gem made of crystals. This gem symbolizes the ultimate realization of Buddhism, the “Nirvana.”</p>
    
    <p>The shrine room found in Ruwanwelisaya is famous for its uniqueness decorated with a Wahalkada where you can find engravings of lions, tusk elephants, horses, cattle, lotuses, and the “Kalpa Wruksha” (a divine tree which fulfills your desires ). Moreover, once you pass them, you would see the remainings of the paintings which once have lightened up the whole place. Inside the shrine room, there are four Buddha statues representing Kakusandha, Konagama, Kasyapa, and Gautama. There is another statue representing the Maithree Bodhisattva. The most significant monument in this shrine room is the footprint of the Buddha which is done in marble with the 108 auspicious marks. Two other Buddha statues are representing the “Piriniwan Manchakaya” ( last moment of the Buddha ) and the other one carved in granite in a seated posture. Two statues of King Dutugemunu and King Elara who has once been his rival can be seen in this shrine room.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/mirisawetiya-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="mirisawetiya-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Mirisawetiya</h4>
    Mirisawetiya stupa stands between the Basawkkulama Tank and Tissa Tank. Mirisawetiya is the first Stupa done under the patronage of King Dutugemunu. According to the folklore, this name was fashioned after a mistake done by the king. King Dutugemunu keeping the promise to his father, offered the first portion of his every meal to Buddhist monks. One day mistakenly he dined without offering meals. It was a “Miris” (chili) curry. As compensation to his grave mistake, he built a stupa and named it Mirisawetiya.</p>
    
    <p>Because of the severe droughts and various illnesses, Sri Lankan kings had to shift the kingdom to Polonnaruwa. This influenced severely on all the religious constructions in Anuradhapura with the loss of kings’ patronage for their betterment. Mirisa Wetiya because of the state of negligence reached its decadence. Later during the British Era, fascinated by the unique Wahalkada, they started to find the lost construction. Even after the British, Sri Lankan politicians who came into power continued with the digging process. Finally, they restored the old Mirisa Wetiya. However, the night before the opening the Stupa collapsed. During the period of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a former president, the Stupa was renovated. With the contribution of all the politicians today Mirisa Wetiya shines as one of the most magnificent stupas in Sri Lanka.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/sri-ma-bodhi-tree-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="sri-ma-bodhi-tree-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Sri Ma Bodhi Tree</h4>
    The oldest tree with a recorded date of the plantation is Sri Ma Bodhi tree which is planted in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. The history of this holy tree runs back to the 288 BCF. Venerable Sangamitta Therani brought this to Sri Lanka accepting the request from Venerable Mahinda Thero, the Buddhist missionary who came to spread Buddhism in the country. From that day onwards until today this sacred tree has been subjected to veneration by all the Buddhists scattered around the world. In the history, there were instances where separate groups were assigned for the protection of this tree from outsiders. That is a clear indication of the importance of the tree.</p>
    
    <p>Your behavior should not cause any harm to the respectability of the sacred tree. Starting from your attire to the way you talk, your respect for this holy and most venerated tree should be demonstrated.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/abhayagiriya-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="Abhayagiriya">
    
    <h4>Abhayagiriya</h4>
    Abhayagiriya was a stupa constructed under the patronage of King Walagamba who was also known as King Wattagamini Abhaya. Walagamba is the king who freed the country from Indian usurpers who ruled the country for so many years.</p>
    
    <p>According to the descriptions of the monk Fa-Hsien, once upon a time this gigantic stupa was decorated with gold, silver and thousands of jewels. But as a results of centuries of negligence this place became deteriorated. But few years back the Archeological Department of Sri Lanka started restoring this stupa to its former glamour.</p>
    
    <p>The name of this stupa has an interesting background story. When the King Walagamba was fleeing from the usurpers, a Hindu monk called “Giri” yelled “The great black Sinhala king is fleeing”. At that moment the king did not bother to do anything about this insulting comment but it got stamped in his mind. Later on, after defeating the invaders, king returned to this place and smashed the whole place to the ground and built a stupa on its ruins. Combining a part of his own name “Abhaya” and the Hindu monk “Giri” he named this stupa as Abhayagiriya.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/lowamahapaya-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="Lowamahapaya">
    
    <h4>Lowamahapaya</h4>
    The vast area between the Ruwanwelisaya and the Jaya Sri Ma Bodhi Tree is covered with thousands of stone pillars. These are the only remainings of a great nine-story construction served as a Buddhist monastery. In the second century BC, this massive construction was built and donated by the great King Dutugemunu for the betterment of Buddhism. This place is also known as the Brazen Palace or the Loha Prasada. The name "Brazen Palace" was given as a result of the Bronze that was utilized for the roofing. The archeological knowledge in the past invested in this great work amazes even the modern archeologists. According to the beliefs of the archeologists a refectory, a chapter house and an assembly hall have been included in this monument. Today there is only a small chapter house which is being utilized by the monks. Unfortunately, the original construction cannot be witnessed today.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/thuparamaya-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="thuparamaya-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Thuparamaya Dagaba</h4>
    Thuparamaya holds a special place in the hearts of the Buddhists as it is the first stupa built after the introduction of Buddhism in Sri Lanka by King Devanampiyatissa. This stupa is such an invaluable place which enshrines the sacred right collar bone of the Lord Buddha which was a gift from India celebrating the years of friendship. This stupa was built according to the guidance of the Buddhist missionary Arahat Mahinda Thero who came to Sri Lanka with the intention of spreading Buddhism in the country.
    The “Watadageya,” the stupa house characterizes this stupa as one of the rare manifestations of craftsmanship. Even though all that remain in this place are four concentric circles of stone pillars around the stupa, the grace and beauty of this whole place is still present.
    Once this stupa had been decorated with gold and silver. And there was a Stupa house (watadageya) protecting the stupa and it was built with golden bricks. This was further protected with golden doors. Later the South Indian invaders who were known as Pandyans destroyed the whole place and robbed all the wealth.</p>
   
    <img src="/assets/images/samadhi-buddha-statue-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="samadhi-buddha-statue-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Samadhi Buddha Statue</h4>
    Made out of dolomite marble, Samadhi Buddha Statue captures of the Lord Buddha’s never-ending kindness in the marble. The statue is 7 feet and 3 inches is in height. The most astonishing fact about the statue is that when you look at the statue in three different angles you see completely different features. When you look from the left you will see a sadness evoked from the features, when looked from the right you can see a slight smile and when looked from the front the features are neutral. Thus, Samadhi Buddha Statue is a monument which you must not ever miss when you are visiting Anuradhapura.</p>
    
    <img src="/assets/images/ritigala-forest-monastery-anuradhapura.jpg" alt="ritigala-forest-monastery-anuradhapura">
    
    <h4>Ritigala Forest Monastery</h4>
    Ritigala is an eco-tourist destination with a cultural as well as a religious value. This is the highest mountain in the north-central province. It stands in the midst of the dry plains of Anuradhapura, 766 meters above this sea level. The vegetation and the animals inhabit in Ritigala make the place rich in natural diversity. Wild elephants, bears, and even leopards can be spotted in the area. There are 70 caves in Ritigala, and the monks have used them from a very long time. There are inscriptions which indicate that this place had been a monastery retreat for hermit monks. This place also named as “Aritta Pabbatha” and was also being used by the kings as a hiding place from the Indian invaders. From the foot of the mountain, a short climb will take you to an area of 120 acres where the ruins are dispersed across the domain. Another notable feature of this place is the meditation platforms and the walkways which have been built without any disturbance to the natural flow of the vegetation.
