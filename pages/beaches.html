      <h2>Arugam Bay</h2>
      <img src="/assets/images/arugam-bay.webp" alt="Arugam Bay" />
      <p>
        Arugam Bay is one of the most spectacular beaches on the Indian Ocean.
        It has an excellent reputation for being an exotic and classic beach
        in the pearl of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka. Among the different
        coastal destinations in this tiny little island, Arugam Bay is well
        known to attract tourists for its surfing culture. Located on the
        southeast coast of Sri Lanka, Arugam Bay has turned into a popular
        tourist destination within a short period, offering a magnificent
        seaside with many water activities.
      </p>
      <h3>History and Cultural Significance</h3>
      <p>
        Originally inhabited by mostly Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims, Arugam
        Bay was called "Ullae." It is situated adjacent to a small market town
        called Pottuvil. Apart from surfing, Arugam Bay has a lot to offer
        such as bars, nightlife, beaches, lagoons, historical temples, and
        also wildlife destinations.
      </p>
      <img src="/assets/images/arugam-bay-surfing.jpg" alt="arugam-bay-surfing" />
      <h3>Surfing in Arugam Bay</h3>
      <p>
        Arugam Bay is one of the top three surfing spots in the world and is
        the international surfing location for the ‘International Surfing
        Competitions.’ Arugam Bay has great waves during the surfing seasons,
        making it a once in a lifetime opportunity for anyone.
      </p>
      <h4>Main Surfing Points</h4>
      <p>
        There are three thrilling points in Arugam Bay: ‘The Point,’ ‘Pottuvil
        Point,’ and ‘Crocodile Point.’ These three main points are ideal spots
        for surfing and swimming. Notably, Arugam Bay has sectional right-hand
        wave breaks that are long and consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than these three main points, there are many other wave-breaking
        points to have the best surfing experience in your life. With the
        moon-shaped curly waves, soft golden sun, and fresh sea breeze, points
        at Arugam Bay have become perfect places for surfing. You will also be
        able to find many such breaking points for surfing by just walking 45
        minutes along the beach to the north or south. The best time to enjoy
        the real surfing experience in Arugam Bay is between April to October
        each year.
      </p>
      <img src="/assets/images/arugam-bay-surfing-lessons.jpg" alt="arugam-bay-surfing-lessons" />
      <h3>Arugam Bay Surfing Lessons</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike in southern coastal areas, surfing lessons in Arugam Bay are
        slightly different. Almost all the surfing schools are conducted by
        the local people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though we say lessons, they provide a good surfing experience.

        other requirements for tourists. The best time to surf Arugam Bay is
        April to October, most probably without rain during that period. If

        Surfing guides will teach you how to be safe in the water without
        getting hurt. If you are a beginner, the best time to take surfing
        lessons would be the offseason to avoid the crowded months. Another
        excellent option for beginners is to stay more weeks after the season
        or before the season and try surfing safely.

        Two enormous reef complexes off the coast of Yala National Park draw
        snorkelers' attention. Clean and fresh water in this area allows you
        to take underwater photographs while diving with fish, coral reefs,
        and sandstones.
